# ZERO-readiness dogfood loop (FE-first) — the driver

> **This is the primary loop** for getting ZERO tier production-ready and
> publishable. The other docs are its parts:
> [`SAMPLE_TEST_TARGETS.md`](./SAMPLE_TEST_TARGETS.md) = what to test,
> [`ZERO_TIER_GAPS.md`](./ZERO_TIER_GAPS.md) = known gaps backlog,
> [`SESSION_LOOP.md`](../../SESSION_LOOP.md) = the backend TDD mechanics you drop
> into when the UI reveals a defect.

## The principle: FE-first, BE-on-mismatch

Dogfood Suitest by **using its own frontend** to test one real web app, fully,
exactly as a ZERO-tier QA user would. Drive the **UI**, not the API.

- A journey step works in the UI → move on.
- A journey step is **missing or broken** in the UI → that is the bug. Drop to
  the backend, find root cause, fix it (TDD per `SESSION_LOOP.md`), then
  **re-verify through the UI**.
- Repeat until the **whole journey completes through the UI**, against the **real
  backend** (no mocks), with **no LLM**, against a **real target site**.

Why FE-first: the UI is the actual user contract. A green backend unit test does
not prove a ZERO user can do the thing. The UI completing the journey does.

## The one journey to drive (dogfood)

Target under test: **Swag Labs (https://www.saucedemo.com)** — full FE_WEB
journey, ZERO-friendly, public creds (see `SAMPLE_TEST_TARGETS.md` Target A).
Tool under improvement: **Suitest itself**, at ZERO tier, empty DB.

**What "empty DB" means here:** keep **only the user account** (so login works);
**zero test data** — no projects, suites, test cases, runs, or defects. A
workspace may be auto-provisioned on first login or created in step 2; nothing
else exists. This is the real fresh-install state, and it is exactly what exposes
blocker #1: with no seeded test cases, the user *must* be able to create
everything from the UI.

Drive these steps **only through the Suitest web UI**, starting from nothing:

1. Log in to Suitest.
2. **Create workspace → project → suite** from scratch.
3. Add an MCP provider (`playwright-mcp`) and **Test connection**.
4. Author a case for saucedemo (login → cart → checkout): add steps with the
   provider per step, expected results, assertions; reorder steps.
5. Search the case you just made.
6. **Run now** → watch live status/logs stream.
7. View results: steps, pass/fail, artifacts (screenshots/HAR), replay.
8. See it on the analytics dashboard (pass rate, coverage, readiness).
9. Mark the suite as a **gating suite**.
10. Make it fail (e.g. wrong assertion) → triage from artifacts → file/view a defect.
11. Confirm every LLM-only control is **hidden or shows an upgrade hint** (ZERO).

Exit when all 11 pass through the UI against a real backend and a live saucedemo.

## Current state (grounded survey, 2026-06-28)

The FE is feature-complete for **viewing, authoring, running, debugging** — but
**cannot bootstrap from empty**, which is the whole ZERO start. Blockers the loop
will hit, in journey order:

| Journey step | State | Note |
|--------------|-------|------|
| 2. Create workspace/project/suite | **BUILT (2026-06-28)** | Blocker #1 closed. Backend `POST /workspaces` added (creator→OWNER + ZERO capability); FE create dialogs — workspace (sidebar picker `＋ New workspace` + switch), project + suite (Cases screen bootstrap empty states). See Progress note below. |
| 3. MCP "Test connection" exposure | **BUILT (UI, 2026-06-28)** | Integrations → MCP tab → `McpServersPanel` "Add Custom MCP" → `RegisterMcpModal` has a wired, ungated **Test connection** (`mcp-test-connection` → `POST /mcp/providers/test-connection`); bundled `playwright-mcp` listed; vitest-covered. The legacy "All"-tab card's Test-connection button is a disabled M2 placeholder (ignore it). A *live* connection test needs a real `playwright-mcp` server running — that lands with the step-6/7 run iteration. |
| 5. Search | **BUILT (2026-06-28)** | The cases filter was a disabled "ships in M1d" stub; now a live client-side search (name + public id), ZERO/no-gating. Locked in the real-backend e2e. |
| 9. Gating suite config | PARTIAL | Gating wrappers exist; no dedicated config screen found. |
| 1,4,5,7,8,10,11 | EXISTS | Login, step editor + reorder, generators modal, run + live WS, results + replay, dashboard, defects, `<Gated>` — all present. |

E2E harness reality: a Playwright suite exists at `apps/web/` **but it intercepts
`/api/v1/**` with fixtures** — it does not exercise the real backend. For this
loop, that is not enough: we need a **real-backend E2E mode** (UI → live API →
runner → DB), because the bugs we care about live in the FE↔BE seam.

## Progress log

**2026-06-28 — blocker #1 (bootstrap UI) + real-backend e2e harness.**

- Backend: `POST /workspaces` (`apps/api/.../routers/workspaces.py`, `services/workspace_service.py::create_workspace_for_user`) — any authenticated user creates a workspace, becomes OWNER, gets a seeded ZERO `WorkspaceCapability`. Tests: `apps/api/tests/test_workspace_create.py`.
- Frontend create UI: `CreateWorkspaceDialog` (wired into the sidebar picker — `＋ New workspace` + clickable switch), `CreateProjectDialog` + `CreateSuiteDialog` (Cases screen: `projectId === null` → "Create your first project"; `suites === 0` → "Create your first suite"; persistent `New suite` button). Hooks: `use-workspaces.ts`, `use-projects.ts`, `useCreateSuite` in `use-test-cases.ts`.
- Real-backend e2e (iteration 2): `make e2e-real` → `apps/api/scripts/seed_zero_e2e.py` (one user + one EMPTY workspace) + `apps/web/playwright.realbackend.config.ts` boots ZERO api (`make dev-api-zero`, LLM env stripped) + web and drives `e2e/realbackend/bootstrap.spec.ts` through the live stack (no `/api` mocks). **Journey steps now locked in the e2e: 1 (login), 2 (create project + suite), 4 (author a manual case), 5 (search), 11 (ZERO hides AI panel + AI tab).** Remaining for the e2e: 3 (live MCP test-connection — UI built, needs a real `playwright-mcp`), 6–7 (Run now + results — needs the runner + MCP), 8 (dashboard), 9 (gating suite), 10 (defect triage).

**Blocker #2 CLOSED — manual case authoring (journey step 4).** The "Write manually" empty-state actions were dead (no `onClick`) and no `POST /test-cases` was wired in the FE — a ZERO user could only get cases via generators. Added `CreateCaseDialog` + `useCreateTestCase` + a persistent `New case` button, and wired the three empty-state actions (From OpenAPI / Record session → generators; Write manually → the dialog). Unit-locked; works in the fresh-install single-workspace path.

**Run pipeline (journey steps 6–7) is REAL and GREEN.** Drove a real ZERO run end-to-end against the live stack (api `:4000` + `make dev-runner` + Redis): `POST /runs` → ARQ → `run_test_case` → `playwright-mcp` spawned via `npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest` → `browser_navigate https://www.saucedemo.com` → **run `R-1002` PASS** (1/1 step). The fix that greened it: raise the bundled playwright-mcp `spawn_timeout_seconds`/`call_timeout_seconds` (the first spawn npx-fetches the package + downloads a browser, blowing the 30s default → `MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT`). Reproduce with the live stack + `/tmp/run_saucedemo.py`. **Remaining for the e2e:** lock "Run now → PASS" through the UI (run-detail UI + WS streaming already built; needs the runner in the e2e orchestration + a seeded runnable case). S3/MinIO (`SUITEST_S3_ENDPOINT` configured) only matters once steps emit screenshots.

**Blocker #3 — `public_id` global-unique vs per-workspace generation (real multi-tenant bug, the dogfood loop surfaced it for BOTH test_cases and runs). `test_cases` FIXED (migration 0037); `runs` FIXED (migration 0038 — this is what unblocked `POST /runs` 500→202); `requirements`/`defects` still OPEN (`defects` already has a `workspace_id` column → just a constraint swap).** `test_cases.public_id` is `unique=True` (GLOBAL; `packages/db/.../models/case.py:37`) but `generate_public_id` (plpgsql) mints **per-workspace** `TC-N` sequences (`pubid_<workspace>_TC`), so the first case in **any second workspace** is `TC-1` and collides → `POST /test-cases` 500 `uq_test_cases_public_id`. `test_cases` has **no `workspace_id` column** (only `suite_id`), so the fix is a careful core-table migration — either add `workspace_id` + composite unique `(workspace_id, public_id)`, or switch to a single global `TC` sequence (and seed it above the current max). This blocks creating the first case in 2nd+ workspaces in real use, and makes the real-backend e2e's case-authoring step non-deterministic against a shared dev DB (so that assertion is deferred to after this fix). **Next backend TDD task.** Scope (systemic): the SAME bug exists on **all four** per-workspace public-id entities — `test_cases`, `defects`, `requirements`, `runs` all declare `public_id unique=True` (global). `TestCase` is constructed at 4–5 insert sites (`test_case_service.py` create+clone, `generator_service.py` ×2, `repositories/test_cases.py`) — each must set the new `workspace_id` if going the column+composite-unique route. Prefer ONE consistent strategy across the four entities; one migration per table; verify with a RED test that creates the same auto `TC-1`/`R-1`/etc. in two workspaces.

Findings worth carrying forward:

- **Login at ZERO works** — `routes/login.tsx` has a real email+password form (`POST /auth/cookie/login`); Google OAuth is secondary/optional. The "OAuth-only" note in `e2e/golden-path.spec.ts` is stale.
- **0-workspace users can't reach the shell (separate onboarding gap).** `routes/_app.tsx#beforeLoad` fetches `/projects`, which 400s without an `X-Workspace-Id`; a user with zero memberships therefore redirects to `/login`. The fresh-install path has the bootstrap default workspace, so the dogfood is unaffected — but a freshly-registered/invited user with no workspace is stuck. Track as a ZERO onboarding follow-up (the create-workspace UI is only reachable once you already have ≥1 workspace).

## The loop procedure

Each iteration:

1. **Stand up the real stack, ZERO tier, empty DB.** Seed **only the user
   account** (login must work); no projects/suites/cases/runs/defects.
   (Onboarding gap `Z1` may bite here — fix it if so.)
   - Verify tier is ZERO: capabilities show no LLM; LLM controls hidden.
2. **Pick the lowest journey step that does not yet pass through the UI.**
3. **Try it in the real UI** (drive with Playwright against the live app, or by
   hand). Observe the actual result.
4. **If it works** → write/extend a **real-backend E2E test** that locks it in,
   then go to the next step.
5. **If it is missing/broken** → this is the defect:
   - Reproduce, then trace: is the screen missing, the API call missing, the
     contract wrong, or the backend behavior wrong?
   - Fix root cause **backend-first per `SESSION_LOOP.md`** (RED → GREEN), then
     build/adjust the FE screen, then **re-drive the UI step** to confirm.
   - If it matches a known item in `ZERO_TIER_GAPS.md`, tick it there.
6. **Re-run the whole journey** to catch regressions. Commit (conventional, no
   co-author trailer).

Stop the loop when the **exit checklist** below is fully green.

## First three iterations (concrete)

1. **Build the bootstrap UI** (blocker #1): create-workspace, create-project,
   create-suite flows in the UI, wired to the existing backend create endpoints.
   Done = a brand-new empty Suitest gets its first suite entirely via the UI.
2. **Real-backend E2E mode:** add a Playwright run config that drives the UI
   against a live api+runner+postgres (no `/api` mocks) — the harness this loop
   runs on. Done = the journey-so-far is green against the real stack in CI.
3. **MCP test-connection + first real run:** surface "Test connection" in the
   providers screen; author the saucedemo login case; "Run now"; watch it pass
   live. Done = a real run of a real site, started and observed entirely in the UI.

## Exit checklist — ZERO tier ready to publish (OSS)

**Functional (the journey):**
- [ ] All 11 journey steps complete through the UI, real backend, empty start.
- [ ] Real-backend E2E suite green in CI (not just mocked E2E).
- [ ] A real run of saucedemo passes, started + triaged entirely via the UI.
- [ ] Every LLM-only control is hidden or shows an upgrade hint at ZERO.

**Onboarding:**
- [ ] One documented root command brings the stack up, healthy, empty (`Z1`).
- [ ] getting-started doc walks the exact journey above and matches reality.

**OSS publish hygiene:**
- [ ] LICENSE present; README has quickstart + the journey screenshot/gif.
- [ ] No secrets/credentials in repo or history; `.env.example` only.
- [ ] `make ci` green (lint + typecheck FE+BE + tests + web tests).
- [ ] No dead/broken screens; no console errors on the journey screens.
- [ ] Docs banners (built vs spec) accurate for what actually ships at ZERO.

When this checklist is green, ZERO tier is production-ready and publishable. The
LLM backlog ([`LLM_TIER_GAPS.md`](./LLM_TIER_GAPS.md)) is the next phase, not a
blocker for the OSS publish.
